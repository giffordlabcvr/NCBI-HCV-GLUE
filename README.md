# NCBI-HCV-GLUE: Phylogenomic Analysis of Hepatitis C Virus

## Overview

An extension to **[HCV-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/HCV-GLUE)** containing all published HCV data from NCBI, plus analysis logic for HCV genomes.

## Installation

If you have not done so already, install the GLUE software framework by following the [installation instructions](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/installation) on the GLUE web site: 

Then build the HCV-GLUE base project: download the **[HCV-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/HCV-GLUE)** repository and build it according to the instructions.

Once you have done this, you may build the NCBI-HCV-GLUE project via the GLUE command prompt as follows:

## Usage

GLUE contains an interactive command line environment focused on the development and use of GLUE projects by bioinformaticians. This provides a range of productivity-oriented features such as automatic command completion, command history and interactive paging through tabular data. 

For detailed instructions on how to use HCV-GLUE for your comparative genomic analysis, refer to the GLUE software environment's [reference documentation](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/).
